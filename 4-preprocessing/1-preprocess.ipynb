    "**We should quantitatively measure the quality of OCR (error rate), but it takes time and we do not focus on this field. Below are the related works:**\n",
    ">The first method is used by Simon Tanner, Trevor Muñoz, and Pich Hemy Ros in their evaluation of the OCR quality of the British Library’s 19th Century Online Newspaper Archive. Working with a sample of 1% of the 2 million pages digitized by the British Library, the team calculated the highest rates of OCR accuracy achieved by comparing the generated XML text to a “double re-keyed” ground-truth version. Having a verified ground-truth document enabled the team to provide accurate results about the quality of generated texts (which were generally disappointing, particularly for proper nouns and “significant” or content words). Their approach, however, is labor and time intensive – more than can be taken on by most individual scholars with limited financial resources. (Tanner, Simon, Trevor Muñoz, and Pich Hemy Ros. “Measuring Mass Text Digitization Quality and Usefulness: Lessons Learned From Assessing the OCR Accuracy of the British Library’s 19th Century Online Newspaper Archive.” D-Lib Magazine 15, no. 7/8 (2009): §5. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1045/july2009-munoz)    \n",
    "The second approach, which the Mapping Texts team used for their analysis of the OCR accuracy of the Texas newspapers in Chronicling America, is to compare the generated text to an authoritative wordlist and compute the number of words outside the approved set. This approach is easier to implement, as it takes much less time to compile a list of relevant words than to re-key even a 1% sample of the text. However, the results are less accurate. The method is blind to places where the OCR engine produced a word that, while in the wordlist, does not match the text on the page or where spelling variations that occur on the page are flagged as OCR errors because they are not included in the word list.

The spelling correction job could improve the fluency of sentences but does not contribute to extracting representative words for topic modeling, plus it takes time to compute, those drawbacks cannot resolve by tuning parameters. Furthermore, the dictionary is used for spelling check is modern English, which may consider some 100 year ago correct words as incorrect, and currently we did not have the time to find dictionaries for English of that era.
